This is a place for me to record analysis that I find interesting.

Its probably going to be a work in progress for the foreseeable future... but then again I am primarily using it for me to store random projects and analysis that I worked on in the past.  Kindof like a Wikipedia... but just for my own reference.

While it is primarily for me so far, I hope that others can find it useful!

Enjoy!
